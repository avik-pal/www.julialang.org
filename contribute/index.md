# Julia Ecosystem Contributor's guide

## Welcome!
The purpose of this document is to help YOU contribute to the Julia Ecosystem. You don't need to be a seasoned developer to help Julia grow and improve.  
Anyone willing to contribute will find here a roadmap from zero to hero (or from a hundred to one thousand, if you are a pro contributor already). Both code and non-code contributions are welcome, no matter your level of experience or background. This document aims to help you find out:

- how you can contribute to match your skills and interests
- what tools and resources can help you contribute confidently
- where you can find ideas for fixes to propose in your first contribution

## Why contribute?
There is a spectrum of benefits to contributing - some more obvious than others. Open source projects rely on contributions from volunteers, enabling them to grow and develop. You will be making a difference to one of the most quickly growing languages, and the future of open-source software as a whole. Benefits of contributing:  

- engage with the community
- build a track record of public contributions (e.g.. GitHub) which will help your career
- build confidence with the language and the libraries
- gain exposure for your library

Types of contributions vary depending on your experience, background, and the nature of your interest in Julia. Types of contributions  

- improving documentation
- sharing your (new) package
- review a package submitted to the Julia Registry
- file a bug report
- write tests
- contributing to core Julia
- contributing to other libraries

and more.

## Chose your path
Your next step is to identify which kind of contributor you are.
There are multiple paths, some of which cross. Here is a high-level overview of how you might want to contribute.
The question is: do you want to ...

- Discover
- Connect
  - read the code of conduct
  - ask questions on Slack or Discourse
  - engage on Twitter
- Learn
- Build
  - write a blogpost
  - cite Julia
  - report a bug
  - make a feature request
  - make a pull request
  - review documentation
  - share a use case
  - develop and submit a library
  - include future pans for your library
- Help
  - spread the word about Julia's Ecosystem
  - submit a use case
  - answer questions on Slack and Discourse
  - contribute something that isn't addressed in this guide!

## How do I find contributing opportunities?

If by this point you are convinced that contributing is for you, but don't know where and how to find contributing opportunities, we have collated a couple of ideas for you. For each idea, we have provided a list of *prerequisites* and *estimated time* to make the contribution.


### Find a README file to edit

There are plenty of documentation files in the Julia-verse on GitHub, and typos are so easy to make! You can help clean up documentation by correcting typos or errors which you find. 

- pre-requisites: GitHub account, text editor with spell checking (e.g. MS Word, Google docs)
- estimated time: 1h
- steps:
  - [pick a Julia package](#how-to-find-julia-packages)
  - find a typo to fix (e.g. paste the text into Google docs for a spell-check)
  - go through a few green buttons on GitHub to submit your contribution
	
### Find questions to answer: StackOverflow
- pre-requisites: you do not need an account to find a question, but you will need a StackOverflow account to answer one
- estimated time: depends on the question and your experience with the topic
- steps: open [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and search for questions, tagged `[julia]`. For this, enter in the search box tag `[julia]`. You will see a list of the most recent questions related to Julia. Surely, if you are interested in a more specific question, e.g. the Plots library, substitute the search term with `[Plots.jl]`
	
To stay up-to-date on StackOverflow questions related to Julia, you can also join #stackoverflow-feed channel on [Slack](https://julialang.slack.com). If something you know how to answer comes up - thats' an immediate chance to help!


### Find questions to answer: Discourse
A great place to both post and find questions is on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)

- pre-requisites: you do not need an account to find a question, but you will need an account to answer a question
- estimated time: depends on the question and your experience with the topic
- steps: click the 'Reply' button under a question on the Discourse page, and share your knowledge

	
### Find open issues of packages
- pre-requisites: GitHub account, development tools ([installed Julia](#how-to-install-julia), an [IDE](#what-are-the-ide-options?))
- estimated time: from ~1h to days or months (try starting with simpler issues)
- steps:
  - [pick a Julia package](#how-to-find-julia-packages) and open its GitHub page
  - on GitHub, open the 'Issues' tab
  - open an issue and read through the existing discussion
  - participate in the discussion and/or solve the issue


### How to find Julia packages

The list of Julia packages, organized *thematically*, can be found at https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages. Click on the name of the package to discover its website, GitHub repository, and further details. 

The list of packages all registered, organized *alphabetically*, can be found at https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General

## What are the IDE options?

An integrated development environment (IDE) can help make software development easier. Some options include [Juno](https://junolab.org/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install).

## How to cite Julia?

For citations, please refer to the [research](https://julialang.org/research/) page on the Julia website.
